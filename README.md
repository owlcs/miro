# MIRO â€“ Minimum Information for Reporting of an Ontology

The MIRO guidelines are a community-validated set of recommendations on what should be reported about an ontology and its development, most importantly in the context of ontology description papers intended for publishing in scientific journals or conferences.

The detailed, most up to date [MIRO guidelines](https://github.com/owlcs/miro/blob/master/miro.md "MIRO guidelines") are maintained on GitHub.
